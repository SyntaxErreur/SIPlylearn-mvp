3. Enrollment & Payment Options
When the user clicks “Enroll”, two main choices appear:

SIP It (Systematic Saving Plan)

Takes user to a SIP Calculator Page with detailed plan options.
3.1 SIP Calculator Page
Here the user sees:

Plan Duration: 3, 6, 9, or 12 months.
Return Percentage:
3 Months: 0% return
6 Months: 1% return
9 Months: 2% return
12 Months: 4% return
Saving Amount (daily or monthly).
Expected Total Saving (sum over the plan duration).
Expected Returns (in USD) based on the plan’s percentage.
Domain Selection (for 3- and 6-month plans only).
3 Months & 6 Months: User selects which single domain (e.g., Finance or Tech) they want to access.
9 Months & 12 Months: User automatically gets access to all domains and courses.
Plan Perks Breakdown (combining the old details + new return rates):

Plan	Total Saving	Return %	Reward (Example in USD)	Ads	Domain Access	Certification
3 Months	$91	0%	$0.00	Yes	1 domain only	-
6 Months	$182	1%	$1.82	Yes	1 domain only + University-certified courses	Yes
9 Months	$273	2%	$5.46	No	All domains + all lectures	University-certified
12 Months	$365	4%	$14.60	No	All domains + all lectures	University-certified
Additional Notes:

For 3 & 6 months: The user must choose one domain. Show them how many courses/videos are in each domain so they can decide.
For 9 & 12 months: No domain selection required; user automatically gets all courses.
3.2 Selecting the SIP Payment Method
Monthly Payment: User pays once each month for the chosen plan duration.
Daily Payment: User chooses an amount ($1 to $100 per day); the system calculates the total monthly/plan cost, plus the associated return.
Example:

If user selects 9 Months and Daily with $3/day, total = $3 × 30 days × 9 months = $810 (approx.). The return is 2% of total. (Exact calculations can vary based on how you handle partial months—your MVP can approximate.)
Note: The example above differs from the simplified lumpsum approach (273 USD for 9 months). You may unify or show both “Lumpsum total” vs. “Daily approach total.” The key is to let the user see how daily Saves accumulate to match or exceed the plan minimum.
